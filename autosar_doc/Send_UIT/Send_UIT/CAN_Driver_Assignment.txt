Refer:
1. CAN SWS Spec and CAN SRS Spec (Version 4.3.0)
2. CAN HW UM of STM32

Investigation:
1. Initialization process for STM32 HW
   - Opertion mode
   - Supported buffer types
   - Filter list
   - Interrupt
   - Proposal for Can_Init() APIs

2. Trasmission Data frame
   - Transmit Can_Wite
   - What is differences between buffer type
   - Follow chart for Seting bufffer data for transmit base On requirement SWS

3. Reception Data frame
   - POLLING or INTERRUPT
   - BUFFER TYPEs
   - Proposal for Can_MainFunction_Read() if polling
   - Or Proposal for Interrupt handling
   
4. Sleep and Wake-up (if HW supports)
   - If HW supports
   - Proposal for Can_MainFunction_Wakeup()
   - Or Interrupt SWS
   
WPs:
1. Proposal by Word document .doc
   - Describing Functionalities of HW
   - Follow chart for proposal API
2. Driver source code
   - Can.c
   - Can.h
3. Proposal SamepleApp for Transmiting CAN data frame (if any)
   - Sequence of API need be called?
   - E.g: Can_Init()
